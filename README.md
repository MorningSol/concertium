# Concertium

## Purpose

Have you ever had a craving to listen to some live music, but you weren't sure what concerts were available in your city? You then do a Google search only to find that you don't know any of the bands that are coming to your area. Well, Concertium is your one-stop-shop to find out what concerts are coming near you, and what the artists actually sound like. Visit Concertium for up-to-date concert listings in whatever city you live in. Don't know any of the artists/bands listed? Click the "Listen Here" button to get a sneak peek of what they will be bringing to your town. Ready to buy your ticket? Select "Buy a Ticket" and you will be taken to a hub where you can select your preferred tickets for the concert you want to attend. Concertium, we bring people "together for music".

We made extensive use of Bulma's documentation: https://bulma.io/documentation/

The YouTube series "Bulma CSS Tutorial" by The Net Ninja, was also very helpful in learning to use Bulma and overcome some of it's limitations.

The Tutorial "Bulma CSS Tutorial: Builing a landing page" was helpful in overcoming the limits of Bulma when it came to building the Hero.
