We made extensive use of Bulma's documentation: https://bulma.io/documentation/

The YouTube series "Bulma CSS Tutorial" by The Net Ninja, was also very helpful in learning to use Bulma and overcome some of it's limitations.

The Tutorial "Bulma CSS Tutorial: Builing a landing page" was helpful in overcoming the limits of Bulma when it came to building the Hero.
